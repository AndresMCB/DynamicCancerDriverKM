#' Run a simulated causal-inference pipeline over many experiments
#'
#' Repeats a simulation where (1) gene expression is generated, (2) a target
#' gene is simulated from specified parent genes, (3) a causal inference test
#' is run, and (4) performance is evaluated. Results and per-experiment
#' summaries are returned.
#'
#' @param DEG_genes Integer vector of indices for the true driver/parent genes (1-based).
#' @param n_genes Total number of genes to simulate per experiment.
#' @param n_timepoints Number of time points per simulation.
#' @param amplitude_range Numeric length-2 vector giving the min/max amplitude of signals.
#' @param n_repetitions Number of outer repetitions (batches).
#' @param experiments_per_rep Number of experiments to run in each repetition.
#' @param regulation_type Character string for direction of regulation (e.g., "up" or "down").
#'
#' @return A list with:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{results}{List of per-experiment outputs from \code{run_dcdkm_test()}, augmented
#'   with \code{$targetSim} parameters used to generate the target.}

Simulations Folder
==================

This folder contains the outputs of the simulation experiments described in the project.

Structure:
----------
results/
    summaries/
        - CSV files with tidy per-configuration summaries of detection rates
        - summaries_master.csv: combined results from all configurations
    objects/
        - RDS files containing the full simulation result objects (compressed)
        - simulation_results_index.csv: index of saved RDS files and their parameters

sessionInfo.txt
    - R session info (package versions, R version) for reproducibility

How to Use:
-----------
1. Load a full result object in R:
       res <- readRDS("Simulations/results/objects/result_2parentsUp.rds")
       head(res$summaries)

2. Load a tidy summary:
       library(data.table)
       master <- fread("Simulations/results/summaries/summaries_master.csv")
       head(master)

3. Check available result objects and their parameters:
       fread("Simulations/results/objects/simulation_results_index.csv")

Notes:
------
- CSV files are small and version-controlled in Git.
- RDS files may be large; consider using Git LFS or GitHub Releases if needed.
- All files were generated by running `Simulations/save_simulation_results.R` 
  after running the experiment scripts.
